# Aegis-client


### Description
 
Aegis is a multisig collaborative custody service allowing users to protect their bitcoins by locking them to a 2-of-3 multisignature address.
The address is created from two (2) user-supplied extended public keys and one provided by the service. 
This allows users to unlock their bitcoins independently by two signatures, or collaboratively, by providing one valid signature, and getting the second from the service.
